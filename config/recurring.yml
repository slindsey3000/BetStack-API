#
# Timezone: All times are in UTC (EST + 5 hours)
# To change frequency: modify the schedule strings below
# 
# Schedule syntax examples:
#   - "at 8am every day" (daily at 8am)
#   - "every 2 hours" (every 2 hours)
#   - "at 1pm on monday" (weekly)

production:
  # Clean up finished Solid Queue jobs
  clear_solid_queue_finished_jobs:
    command: "SolidQueue::Job.clear_finished_in_batches(sleep_between_batches: 0.3)"
    schedule: every hour at minute 12
  
  # Sync Cloudflare edge cache - Tiered approach for efficiency
  # Critical endpoints (lines, events, results): Every 2 minutes
  # These change frequently with odds updates and game results
  sync_cloudflare_cache_critical:
    class: SyncCloudflareCacheCriticalJob
    queue: default
    schedule: every 2 minutes
  
  # Static endpoints (sports, leagues, teams, bookmakers): Every 30 minutes
  # These rarely change, so less frequent syncing saves resources
  sync_cloudflare_cache_static:
    class: SyncCloudflareCacheStaticJob
    queue: default
    schedule: every 30 minutes
  
  # Sync sports and leagues (once daily)
  sync_sports:

  # Smart scheduler - Intelligent odds and results syncing
  # Runs every minute and decides what needs syncing based on:
  # - League season status (has upcoming games)
  # - Time until next game (frequency tiers: 30min baseline, 10min within 2hrs, 2min within 10min)
  # - Active games (results sync every 2min during/after games)
  # Target: ~17,000 API requests/month
  smart_scheduler:
    class: SmartSchedulerJob
    queue: default
    schedule: every minute
  
  # Clean up old API usage logs (keep 90 days)

  # Tracks which API keys/emails are using the API and abuse attempts
  sync_client_usage:
    class: SyncClientUsageJob

development:
  # Development: No automatic syncing - run jobs manually via console or rake tasks
  # Example: SyncAllOddsJob.perform_now
  # Example: SyncSportsJob.perform_now
  # Example: SyncScoresJob.perform_now
  # Example: SyncCloudflareCacheCriticalJob.perform_now
