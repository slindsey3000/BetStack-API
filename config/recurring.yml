#
# Timezone: All times are in UTC (EST + 5 hours)

# 
# Schedule syntax examples:
#   - "at 8am every day" (daily at 8am)
#   - "every 2 hours" (every 2 hours)
#   - "at 1pm on monday" (weekly)

production:

    class: SyncCloudflareCacheCriticalJob
    queue: default
    schedule: every 2 minutes
